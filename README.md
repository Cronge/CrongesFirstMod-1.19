## Cronge's First Mod

in [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net).

I have just started out making mods because I've always been fascinated by mods like:
- [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) 
- [RLCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rlcraft)
- [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and etc.

<p> I've always wanted to create mods like those, so I decided to learn how—I'm learning Java aswell.


### Current State of the Mod
This mod is currently in ***deveplopment*** and cannnot be released yet due to the *extremely limited knowledge* of modding I have.

<p> I have added only Items so far and plan to add more stuff later on.
 
#### Items:

'Eight Ball'
> From [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3DgVXWirsU&list=PLKGarocXCE1EeLZggaXPJaARxnAbUD8Y_&index=5) video in Kaupenjoe's [Minecraft 1.19 Fabric Modding Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBwPZRk6-SE&list=PLKGarocXCE1FeXvEogpjz4SvHxF_FJRO6)
- Gives a random number everytime you right-click with it.

#### Gemstone Items

Ruby
- Has *2* variants—*raw* and *cut* (normal form).
> Also has a *block* form.
- You can get Raw Ruby from mining *Ruby Ore*.
- *Raw Ruby*  can then be turned into it's  *cut*  form by using the [stonecutter](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Stonecutter?so=search).
