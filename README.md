## Cronge's First Mod!

in [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net).

I've just started out making mods because I've always been fascinated by mods like [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei), [CREATE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) .
<br/> Learning Java because it's *essential* to making mods.

#### Items:

The 'Eight Ball'
> Gives a random number everytime you right-click with it.

#### Gemstones

Ruby
> Has *2* variants, *raw*, and *cut* (normal form).

> You can get Raw Ruby from mining *Ruby Ore*.
 *Raw Ruby*  can then be turned into it's  *cut*  form by using the [stonecutter](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Stonecutter?so=search).
