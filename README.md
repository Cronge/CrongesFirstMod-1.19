## Cronge's First Mod

in [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net).

I've just started out making mods because I've always been fascinated by mods like:
- [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) 
- [RLCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rlcraft)
- [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create), etc
<br/>
<br/> I've always wanted to create mods like those, so I decided to learn how!
> I'm learning Java too because it's *essential* to making mods.

#### Items:

Eight Ball ![Eight Ball](https://github.com/Cronge/CrongesFirstMod-1.19/blob/main/src/main/resources/assets/crongesfirstmod/textures/item/eight_ball.png)
- Gives a random number everytime you right-click with it.

#### Gemstones

Ruby
- Has *2* variants, *raw*, and *cut* (normal form).

- You can get Raw Ruby from mining *Ruby Ore*.
- *Raw Ruby*  can then be turned into it's  *cut*  form by using the [stonecutter](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Stonecutter?so=search).
